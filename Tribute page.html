      Born: April 30 1930 <br>Gender: Male<br>Place:

    <P>Bugs Bunny is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and
      Merrie Melodies series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. Though a similar character first appeared
      in
      the WB cartoon Porky's Hare Hunt (1938)

      Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality.
      He is
      also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catch phrase "Eh...What's up,
      doc?". Due
      to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and
      the
      official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment, but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world. He
      can
      thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos.

      Bugs starred in more than 160 cartoon shorts produced between 1940 and 1964.He has since appeared in feature
      films,
      compilation films, TV series, music records, comics, video games, award shows, amusement park rides, and
      commercials. He
      has also appeared in more films than any other cartoon character, is the 9th most-portrayed film personality in
      the
      world,and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</P>

    <img src="images/bugs-bunny-dies-99.jpg" alt="bugsbunny" height="350" width="430" style="padding-left: 750px; ">
<P>Avery's Porky's Duck Hunt (1937), which had introduced Daffy Duck. Porky Pig is again cast as a hunter tracking a silly
prey who is more interested in driving his pursuer insane and less interested in escaping. Hare Hunt replaces the little
black duck with a small white rabbit. The rabbit introduces himself with the odd expression "Jiggers, fellers," and Mel
Blanc gave the character a voice and laugh much like those he later used for Woody Woodpecker.The rabbit comes back in Prest-O Change-O (1939), directed by Chuck Jones, where he is the pet rabbit of unseen
character Sham-Fu the Magician. Two dogs, fleeing the local dogcatcher, enter his absent master's house. The rabbit
harasses them but is ultimately bested by the bigger of the two dogsThe rabbit's third appearance comes in Hare-um Scare-um (1939), directed again by Dalton and Hardaway..By 1942, Bugs had become the number one star of Merrie Melodies.Bugs' popularity soared during World War II because of his free and easy attitude, and he began receiving special star
billing in his cartoons by 1943. By that time, Warner Bros. had become the most profitable cartoon studio in the United
States.In company with cartoon studios such as Disney and Famous Studios, Warners pitted its characters against
Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Francisco Franco, and the Japanese. Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips (1944) features Bugs at
odds with a group of Japanese soldiers. This cartoon has since been pulled from distribution due to its depiction of
Japanese people. One US Navy propaganda film saved from destruction features the voice of Mel Blanc in "Tokyo
Woes" (1945) about the propaganda radio host Tokyo Rose. He also faces off against Hermann Göring and Hitler in Herr
Meets Hare (1945), which introduced his well-known reference to Albuquerque as he mistakenly winds up in the Black
Forest of 'Joimany' instead of Las Vegas, Nevada. Bugs also appeared in the 1942 two-minute U.S. war bonds
commercial film Any Bonds Today?, along with Porky and Elmer.<br>

At the end of Super-Rabbit (1943), Bugs appears wearing a United States Marine Corps dress blue uniform. As a result,
the Marine Corps made Bugs an honorary Marine master sergeant. From 1943 to 1946, Bugs was the official mascot of
Kingman Army Airfield, Kingman, Arizona, where thousands of aerial gunners were trained during World War II. Some
notable trainees included Clark Gable and Charles Bronson. Bugs also served as the mascot for 530 Squadron of the 380th
Bombardment Group, 5th Air Force, U.S. Air Force, which was attached to the Royal Australian Air Force and operated out
of Australia's Northern Territory from 1943 to 1945, flying B-24 Liberator bombers. Bugs riding an air delivered
torpedo served as the squadron logo for Marine Torpedo/Bomber Squadron 242 in the Second World War. Additionally, Bugs
appeared on the nose of B-24J #42-110157, in both the 855th Bomb Squadron of the 491st Bombardment Group (Heavy) and
later in the 786th BS of the 466th BG(H), both being part of the 8th Air Force operating out of England.<br><br>

In 1944, Bugs Bunny made a cameo appearance in Jasper Goes Hunting, a Puppetoons film produced by rival studio Paramount
Pictures. In this cameo (animated by McKimson, with Blanc providing the usual voice), Bugs (after being threatened at
gunpoint) pops out of a rabbit hole, saying his usual catchphrase; after hearing the orchestra play the wrong theme
song, he realizes "Hey, I'm in the wrong picture!" and then goes back in the hole. Bugs also made a cameo in the
Private Snafu short Gas, in which he is found stowed away in the titular private's belongings; his only spoken line is
his usual catchphrase.<br>

Although it was usually Porky Pig who brought the Looney Tunes films to a close with his stuttering, "That's all,
folks!", Bugs replaced him at the end of Hare Tonic and Baseball Bugs, bursting through a drum just as Porky did, but
munching on a carrot and saying in his Bronx/Brooklyn accent, "And that's the end!"
<br><br>
After World War II, Bugs continued to appear in numerous Warner Bros. cartoons, making his last "Golden Age" appearance
in False Hare (1964). He starred in over 167 theatrical short films, most of which were directed by Friz Freleng, Robert
McKimson, and Chuck Jones. Freleng's Knighty Knight Bugs (1958), in which a medieval Bugs trades blows with Yosemite Sam
and his fire-breathing dragon (which has a cold), won an Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject (becoming the
first Bugs Bunny cartoon to win said award).Three of Jones' films—Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning and Duck! Rabbit,
Duck!—compose what is often referred to as the "Rabbit Season/Duck Season" trilogy and were the origins of the rivalry
between Bugs and Daffy Duck. Jones' classic What's Opera, Doc? (1957), casts Bugs and Elmer Fudd in a parody of
Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. It was deemed "culturally significant" by the United States Library of
Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1992, becoming the first cartoon short to
receive this honor.<br><br>


Bugs and Daffy Duck in the opening of The Bugs Bunny Show (1960-2000).
In the fall of 1960, ABC debuted the prime-time television program The Bugs Bunny Show. This show packaged many of the
post-1948 Warners cartoons with newly animated wraparounds. After two seasons, it was moved from its evening slot to
reruns on Saturday mornings. The Bugs Bunny Show changed format and exact title frequently but remained on network
television for 40 years. The packaging was later completely different, with each cartoon simply presented on its own,
title and all, though some clips from the new bridging material were sometimes used as filler.</P>
